[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17111552.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17111552)

## Overview

This repository provides a framework and tools for evaluating and enhancing adversarial robustness in AI-driven fraud detection systems for digital banking. It includes client data simulation, adversarial attack generation, robustness evaluation, and reporting for quality engineering in financial AI systems.

## Features

- **Quality Engineering Frameworks** for Fraud Detection System evaluation
- **Client Data Generator** for simulating banking transactions
- **Fraud Detection Model** integration (plug in your model)
- **Adversarial Attack Generator** for simulating attacks
- **Adversarial Robustness Evaluator** to test model robustness
- **Robustness Test Suite** with automated test cases and reporting

## System Architecture

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Requirements in `requirements.txt`
- (Optional) Jupyter Notebook for demos

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sunilcodingpro/AdversarialRobustnessinAIDrivenDigitalBanking.git
cd AdversarialRobustnessinAIDrivenDigitalBanking
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. **Configure your fraud detection model** in the provided template.
2. **Generate or load client data.**
3. **Run adversarial attack scenarios.**
4. **Evaluate robustness and analyze results.**

Scripts and notebooks are provided in the `examples/` directory.
