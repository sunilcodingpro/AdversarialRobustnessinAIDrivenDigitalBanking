# Adversarial Robustness in AI-Driven Digital Banking

This repository focuses on exploring various adversarial robustness techniques in the context of AI-driven digital banking solutions. The aim is to enhance the security and reliability of AI models deployed in banking applications.

## Overview

Adversarial attacks can severely impact the performance of AI models, especially in critical sectors like banking. This project investigates methods to improve the robustness of these models against such attacks.

## Goals
- Identify vulnerabilities in AI models used in banking.
- Implement adversarial training techniques.
- Evaluate the performance of robust models.
