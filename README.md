[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17111552.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17111552)

## Overview

Adversarial attacks can severely impact the performance of AI models, especially in critical sectors like banking. This project investigates methods to improve the robustness of these models against such attacks.

## Goals
- Identify vulnerabilities in AI models used in banking.
- Implement adversarial training techniques.
- Evaluate the performance of robust models.
